This project is my implementation of the popular arcade game 'Alien Invasion'. Alien Invasion is a game in which players control a rocket ship and must shoot projectiles
to destroy onccoming fleets of enemy ships. If an alien ship hits the player's ship or an alien ship makes it to the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player
loses three ships, the game is over.
